# Terraform Template Best Practices 🛠️

Creating effective Terraform templates involves more than just writing code; it requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure scalability, maintainability, and reusability. Here's a guide to best practices for crafting Terraform templates:

## Inclusion Guidelines

When creating Terraform templates, consider including the following elements:

### 1. Module Structure 📁

Organize your Terraform code into modular components to promote reusability and maintainability. Use directories to group related resources and modules logically.

Example:

```
--network/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── output.tf
    └── variables.tf 

--server/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── output.tf
    └── variables.tf 
```

### 2. Documentation 📝

Include detailed documentation for each Terraform module, describing its purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage examples. This helps users understand how to use the module correctly.

### 3. Input Variables 📌

Use input variables to parameterize your Terraform modules, allowing users to customize their behavior without modifying the underlying code. 

**Note**: If you do not declare the name of your resources, Terraform will create a unique name for you. This can be problematic because it may not be consistent with how you want to name them and you have to look up the name. **Avoid hardcoded resources**.

### 4. Output Values 💡

Define output values to expose useful information from your Terraform modules, such as resource IDs or connection details, for consumption by other modules or external systems.

### 5. Providers Configuration ⚙️

Centralize provider configuration to ensure consistency across your Terraform templates. Use provider aliases for managing multiple provider configurations within the same template.

### 6. Error Handling 🚨

Implement error handling mechanisms, such as `count` or `count.index` checks, to gracefully handle resource creation failures and recover from errors.


## Template Creation Tips

Follow these guidelines to create effective Terraform templates:

### 1. Start Small 🌱

Begin with simple Terraform templates and gradually add complexity as needed. Focus on creating reusable modules that solve specific problems.

### 2. Versioning 🔄

Use version control systems like Git to track changes to your Terraform templates. Apply semantic versioning to modules to communicate compatibility and changes effectively.

### 3. Testing 🧪

Implement automated testing for your Terraform templates using tools like Terratest or Kitchen-Terraform to validate their behavior against different scenarios.

### 4. Continuous Integration 🔄🚀

Integrate Terraform templates into your CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, validation, and deployment processes. Ensure that tests are run automatically before merging changes.

### 5. Code Reviews 👀

Encourage code reviews for Terraform templates to ensure quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices. Use pull request workflows to facilitate collaboration and feedback.

### 6. Refactoring 🛠️

Regularly refactor and optimize your Terraform templates to improve readability, performance, and maintainability. Remove duplicate code and extract common patterns into reusable modules.


## Practices for Reusability

Promote template reusability by following these practices:

### 1. Generic Modules 🔄

Create generic modules that encapsulate common infrastructure patterns, such as networking or security configurations, for reuse across multiple projects.

### 2. Parameterization 📌

Parameterize your Terraform modules to make them configurable for different use cases. Use input variables to customize module behavior without modifying the underlying code.

### 3. Composition 🧩

Compose complex infrastructure configurations by combining smaller, reusable modules. Use module composition to build higher-level abstractions that represent entire application stacks or environments.

### 4. Dependency Management 📦

Manage module dependencies carefully to ensure proper versioning and compatibility. Use dependency management tools like Terraform's module registry or private module registries to simplify module consumption.

### 5. Documentation 📝

Provide comprehensive documentation for your Terraform modules, including usage examples, input variable descriptions, and output value explanations. Clear documentation encourages adoption and reuse.

## Additional Considerations

Consider adding any additional practices or considerations specific to your organization or project needs here.

- **Sharing Modules**: It's beneficial to publish and share modules within your organization to encourage reuse and standardization.
- **Use of Remote State**: When working in teams, use remote state storage for Terraform to enable collaboration and avoid conflicts.
- **State Encryption**: Encrypt Terraform state files to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Manual State Modification**: Avoid modifying Terraform state files manually to prevent inconsistencies and errors.
- **Benefits of Remote State Storage**: Storing Terraform state files remotely offers benefits such as locking, secure access, and easier sharing and delegation. *I store mine in github* 😉
